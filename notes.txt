This is a bunch of notes and observations on the code of my game.
A Production Rate variable in my GeneratorManager is what dictates the amount of resources.

Generator seems to be a good base for other self-contained systems. 


Possible resources to add for complexity:
	Water:
		Used for keeping health(?) high. 
	
	Well: Used to extract water. Requieres clicks. 	
	Progress Bar on bottom that fills up after enough clicks
		Clicks on well fill water bucket. Requires > 1 click to fill bucket. 
	
Resource philosophy:
	Each resource should be "self contained", in the sense that each resource 
		has a primary function. For example, 'spirits' in Magic Tower only allow
		for the player to purchase units(independant resource gatherers, like druids)
	After obtaining a substantial amount of resources, allow a major upgrade and
		a gamestate change. For example, after getting x of resource 1, 
		and y of resource 2, a new building is built. This new building introduces
		new resources and a new way to speed up primary resource production.
	Present a way to automate every currency. We'll use Generators as example.
		Present a way to increase speed of generators, using primary resource.  
		This is on top of buying more generators. 
Resources & Generators:
	Resources:
		Primary Resource:
			Primary resource will be Nutrients. 
			
		Secondary Resources:
			
			
	Generators:
		Primary Generator:	
			Primary generator will be BUG CATCHER, which will be a drone with a light.
				It should look like a firefly or something. 
				
		Secondary Generators:
